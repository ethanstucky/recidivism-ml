# Machine Learning – Predicting Recidivism
## Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze a real-world criminal justice dataset and predict the likelihood of recidivism within three years of release. The focus is on understanding the full ML workflow, including data preprocessing, baseline comparison, model evaluation, and ethical considerations.

## Technologies

-Python

-Pandas, NumPy

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Scikit-Learn

## Features

-Data cleaning and preprocessing of real-world criminal justice data

-Exploratory data analysis and feature impact visualization.

-Baseline prediction comparison.

-Training and evaluation of:

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

-Analysis of model performance and interpretability.

-Discussion of bias, limitations, and ethical implications of predictive modeling in criminal justice.

## Results

-Logistic regression and KNN models achieved improved accuracy over a baseline prediction strategy.

-Identified influential features such as age, prior offenses, and demographic indicators.

-Highlighted the limitations of accuracy-focused evaluation in sensitive real-world domains.

## How to Run

-Clone the repository.

-Open in preferred notebook (Jupyter, Colab, Etc.)
